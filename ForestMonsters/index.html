		<h1>Welcome to Forest Monsters!</h1>
		<h3>Your objective is to pass by or defeat all the monsters on your way in the forest!</h3>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<h4>
			- Use your keyboard's arrows to move and press [Z] to select something during a battle;<br><br>
			- When you enter a battle, you may use an item to recover 20 HP (Health Points) or attack. When attacking, you'll cause a damage from 10 to 20 HP to your adversary randomly;<br><br>
			- For each five coins you collect, you'll earn an extra potion;<br><br>
			- On your adversary's turn, you'll have to press the keyboard arrow that corresponds to the direction written on your heart five times. If you miss, you lose 10 HP;<br><br>
			- Pay attention to the monsters' colors, because they represent their difficulty level! Tip: During a battle against a purple monster, you'll have to press the opposite of the directions that show up on your heart;<br><br>
			- This game isn't easy! If you die, you'll have to restart it all over from the beginning;<br><br>
			- Try not to kill even a single monster for a different ending;<br><br>
			- Since it's a school project, if the sound isn't working, refreshing the page may solve the problem;<br><br>
			- Good luck, and be sure to give me some feedback after you're done!
